# introduction
The vehicle monitoring is one of the major feature of our project. In this technology it is used to determine the presence of the passanger and if the passanger exist then our system starts the functionality.

So in nowdays everything is becoming automated and everyone is looking for the new products to made the life easier.

in our project the main aim is to design and develop the system which is capable of monitoring the passanger's existance and Heat Monitoring and Displaying.

# Features
Its capable of determining weather the user is edist or not in the vehicle.

• If Passanger was existed in the vehicle it will gives the indication.

. After the indication it will determine the beat

• Driver and the passanger can have the access to modifying the temperature in the vehicle.

• The passanger can modify the temperature by watching the display as the display is given in the system

• Modular Based Programming

# Swot analysis

## Strengths
User Friendly.

Easy to modify the temperature value

• The system is robust.

• Low cost.

• Modular Based Programs
## Weakness
 It's only applicable for the countries which are having having low temperature.
## Opportunities
It can be implemented by replacing heater by air conditioners so that it will be helpful in all the countries.
## Threats
 Not suitable for average or high temperature environment
